## Configure Relay

Find your Relay in the list and click the expand button (`+`) to configure it.

### Relay Info

This tab contains data according to `NIP-11` (Relay Information Document).

> **Note**: the `domain` is added automatically and shoud be corrected manually if needed. This value is used for `NIP-42` (Authentication of clients to relays)

### Payment

By default the relay is free to access, but it can be configured to ask for payments.
It is encourage to also activate the `Require Auth` option for paid relays.

> **Note**: check the info button (`I`) tooltip for a description of each field.

Click on the Relay ID (or visit `https://{your_domain}/nostrrelay/${relay_id}`) for the Relay public page.
Here the entry and storage fees can be paid.

### Config

Configure `NIP-22` (_Event `created_at` Limits_), `NIP-42` (_Authentication of clients to relays_) and other Relay parameters.

Some configurations are not standard (`NIPs`) but they help control what clients are allowed to do, thus blocking (some) attack vectors.

> **Note**: check the info button (`I`) tooltip for a description of each field.

### Accounts

Allows the Relay operator to `Block` or `Allow` certain accounts.

If an account is `allowed` then it is not required to `pay to join`.

When an account is `blocked` it does not matter if it `paid to join` or if it is `allowed`.
